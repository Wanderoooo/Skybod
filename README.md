## Project personal interest
<p>I am a student pilot. During my training, I’ve noticed the significant amount of documentation required pre-
and post-flight. Since aviation is quite a risky hobby, these procedures are essential as to risk management. However,
without a comprehensive checklist in place, it is extremely easy to unintentionally neglect a crucial component. 
Furthermore, student pilots are initially unfamiliar with how to submit certain documents, so an app with a user-friendly
interface with optional tutorial can enhance learning and pre-flight and post-flight documentation processes.</p>
